## HousePricePrediction

This project aims to estimate a house's price based on a set of features describing the house, 
such as the number of rooms, size, etc. The dataset used in this project is from a Kaggle competition. 


**Linear Regression Model**

After cleaning the data, a linear regression model is trained to estimate the house prices. The trained model is then used to predict 
the prices of houses in the test data.
The accuracy of the trained model is evaluated using the test data. The error of the trained model is compared with the error of a similar model trained using 
scikit-learn.
